                <p align="justify">Anthony Alaimo is a business leader with a successful career in both turnarounds and high growth scenarios. He has a dynamic approach to each situation, bringing both creativity and high standards of excellence to develop optimal solutions for all stakeholders. Anthony is a Certified Turnaround Professional as recognized by the Turnaround Management Association. Additionally, he is a certified trainer of the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People as well as the Principle Centered Leadership courses offered by the Covey Leadership Center and brings many of these principles to bear in dealing with high-change environments.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony graduated from Fordham University in 1976 with a B.S. in Accounting. At the age of 21, he was named Controller of the U.S. division of a global Fortune 500 company in the steel industry. The U.S. division promptly grew from $20 million in sales to $104 million over the next four years, through internal growth as well as through acquisitions. Anthony left his position to enter the Harvard Business School, from which he achieved an MBA with honors in 1981. He subsequently began his turnaround career by taking over as the president of a $10 million candy manufacturer with significant losses. After bringing the company to profitability the first year, Anthony engineered a key acquisition of a bankrupt supplier and then was instrumental in the sale of the company a year later.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony began his own consulting practice in 1983 during which he assisted companies in start-up, high growth, and turnaround situations. During this period, Anthony attended Georgetown University and achieved a M.A. in Public Policy. In 1988, Anthony joined an investment company which purchased and rehabilitated troubled entities. In 1990, Anthony formed Coloney Von Soosten + Associates Inc. (“CVS”) along with the other three founders. CVS eventually merged with Aurora Management Partners in 2001. In 2004, Anthony left Aurora to form Valor Leadership Partners LLC (“Valor”). Most of the business Anthony generated as a consultant was from repeat customers and subsequent referrals.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony has developed and implemented turnaround plans both pre- and post-bankruptcy filing, which requires superior analytical skills, creativity, strong leadership and quick decision-making. Anthony has the ability to instill confidence in the turnaround process among all stakeholders. Anthony has also performed valuations and assessments for debtors, private investors and creditors to ascertain viability and/or sale value. Additionally, he has performed fraud investigations and due diligence and has extensive knowledge of the bankruptcy code. One of the many highlights of Anthony’s turnaround career was when he was awarded the 2002 Turnaround of the Year award by the Atlanta Chapter of the TMA for transforming a company facing almost certain liquidation to eventual prosperity. Some of the key aspects of the engagement were difficult negotiations with stakeholders, the uncovering of a $10 million fraud and eventual recovery of significant stolen assets, and an operational restructuring that restored the company to significant profitability.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony’s focus on startups and high growth companies includes strategic planning to foster a business model suited for high growth. Successful implementation of the strategic plan requires unity of mission and Anthony’s leadership abilities have helped many companies unite their stakeholders behind a common mission. Anthony also understands how to identify and remove obstacles to growth in advance of problems. Anthony was instrumental in starting Biotrax, Inc., a health services company, which was later sold to W.R. Grace for $28 million. In addition, Anthony became a key part of the management team of an oil services firm during a three-year-period where the company quadrupled in sales, all from internal growth. Anthony was instrumental in selling that company for in excess of $200 million, an increase of more than 40 times in value. In another engagement, Anthony developed and implemented a plan to acquire a troubled European entity which required closing of several divisions in numerous countries and consolidating operations into one location.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony’s consulting experience covered an extensive variety of industries including manufacturing, distribution, retail, and service. Some of the many sectors in which Anthony has experience include advertising, agriculture, automotive, candy, clothing, construction, defense, electronics, employment, engineering, equipment, food, health care, house wares, HVAC, metal recycling, oil services, printing, real estate, steel, telecommunications, textiles, utilities, toys and transportation.</p>

                <p align="justify">Anthony lives in Peachtree City, GA with his wife Laurie and their four young children. The Alaimos are actively involved in their church and their community.</p>
